  Memcached is a highly performant caching system that helps improve website
  performance.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  Your server has [memcached](http://memcached.org/about) installed. If you are
  planning to use this with a CMS or eCommerce platform, please read their
  documentation on best practices for leveraging Memcache with their product.
  Programming languages like Ruby, PHP, and Python will typically require the
  installation of a module to add memcached support.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html).  Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  [Memcached](http://memcached.org/) was installed via package, and the
  configuration file is /etc/memcached.conf for Ubuntu and
  /etc/sysconfig/memcached for CentOS. Any changes made to the configuration
  will require a restart to the Mecached service.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Additional Notes
  Currently, there is not a way to automatically add nodes to this deployment.
  If you need an additional memcached server, you can deploy another server
  using this tool.
